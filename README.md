 An exercise in TCP/IP Network programming in C#. Contains two async text message sending/receiving applications: One to start a chat server (represented as a winform app) and one to start a client connecting to it (a command prompt console).
 
 
 NOTE: This app only uses your computer's local network and is not for use on public ones. It is for demonstration purposes only.
